How memory is managed in Python?
Memory in Python is primarily managed by Python's private heap space that stores all the data

What is the purpose continue statement in python?
When we want to skip iteration for a certain value that exists in between the range that we are
working on, then we use the continue statement.
eg;
I want to print 1 to 5 but not 3,then my code would be as follows:
for i in range(1,6):
	if(i==3):
		continue
	else:
		print(i)

What are negative indexes and why are they used?
Negative indexes are index values that can be assigned starting from -1 from the last value in the string,list,etc.
towards the 1st character.
They are an alternative to normal indexes primarily useful when we want to reverse out data or access it from the last.
In this case, it proves more useful as we don't require the length of the data to access it's last 2 or 3 numbers and so on.
